This app is built using javascript with help from JQuery, Underscore and Moment.js libraries. I've used an adapter pattern to handle the request to the JSON files.

This program needs a local server running in order to handle the XHR requests correctly. I've been using SimpleHTTPServer as a server. SimpleHTTPServer comes with Python.
Please run the following code in the project's main directory at the command line to start the server.
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
